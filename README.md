# TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a simple setup for getting started building a web application using TypeScript, React, Redux, ImmutableJS, and Glamor.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ccorcos/typescript-boilerplate.git project
cd project
git remote remove origin
npm install

```

An in order to be able to deploy this using Github pages, you'll need to create an push an initial branch to Github:
